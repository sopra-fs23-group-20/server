https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-20/server/issues/57 <br />
#### Description: 
I completed the project setup, which involved converting the client template to TypeScript and transitioning all components to Material UI components. <br />
I started a first attempt of a websocket connection to link the server with the client on /topic/{userToken}, allowing Hints and TimeUpdates to be transmitted from the server directly to the client without requiring periodic GET requests.<br />
I integrated my personal Raspberry Pi computer into the project's CI/CD workflow, enabling automated deployment to the Raspberry Pi, just like with Google Cloud, after each main branch update. <br />
The Raspberry Pi serves as a backup to the Google Cloud server, because currently, websocket connections don't work on Google Cloud and we also don't have a solution yet for a persistent Database (Jonathan and I set-up a PostgreSQL database on Google Cloud, but it would cost 10$ a day).<br />
Both of these issues are solved by the Raspberry Pi, which is why we are currently exploring both options. 
Access to the project hosted on the Raspberry Pi is available via these URLs:<br />
Client: https://sopra-fs23-group20-client.pktriot.net<br />
Server: https://sopra-fs23-group20-server.pktriot.net
#### Tasks for next Week: 
https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-20/client/issues/51 <br />
https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-20/client/issues/50 <br />
https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-20/client/issues/49 <br /> <br />
For next week, I want to establish an additional websocket connection on /topic/games/{gameId} and improve its stability by checking the websocket's connection's status, attempting to reconnect, and switching to periodic GET requests if necessary (currently necessary on Google Cloud) to keep the game up-to-date for the player. <br />
I also want to create another websocket connection on /topic/gameLobbies to automatically update clients with new lobbies, ensuring the gameLobbyOverview page remains up-to-date without requiring the player to consistently refresh the page manually.

#### Description:
I created a Rules page that displays the rules of the game, then I added the possibility to select regions and hints as a lobby creator, and also the feature that only the lobby creator sees the button to start the game. I also added that the game can only be started if at least one region and one hint are selected, and added the possibility to randomize the order acccording to which the hints are displayed (button is disabled when only one hint is selected because randomizing one hint has no effect). I also wrote tests for the CountryCountroller and CountryService classes.

#### Description:
I created a GameHistory. Now you can see in the settings, how many and which games you played. You see furthermore your ranking history and how many participants had joined in the corresponding games. Moreover, I modified and designed the Scoreboard. Additionally, I designed the Scoreboard, Leaderboard and Gamehistory tables uniformly. Now, they all look nice and consistent. Finally, general improvements and bug fixes.--> I did that many tasks, since I might not be able to work on the project next week (due to work).

#### Description:
Wrote unit tests, and integration tests for GameService class. Explained Blitz mode in game rules, and when quickjoin does not work display an alert. I also added an alert when user leaves a game so that it is informed that he/her is not part of it anymore, to avoid any misunderstanding. I also fixed a bug in the flashcards and added possibility to move to next or previosu country with keyboard arrows.

#### Description:
I added a feature which lets the user know what the current hint is and what the next hint will be as well as in how many seconds the hint transitions to the next hint. <br />
I updated the readme to include the deployment for the frontend as well as the backend and I described the main components of the frontend as well as included screenshots of our game. <br />
I added some tests for the new game Mode "Blitz" to test the function which calculates the closest countries to the country to guess. <br />
